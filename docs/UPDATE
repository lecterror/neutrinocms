	NeutrinoCMS Update Guide
	------------------------

	* Extract the new version of NeutrinoCMS over the existing version
	and overwrite all the files

		***
		If you have changed the application settings in ~/app/config/core.php
		exclude that file from the update.
		***

	* Clear the application cache, this means
	deleting all the files in:
		: ~/app/tmp/cache/
		: ~/app/tmp/cache/models/
		: ~/app/tmp/cache/persistent/
		: ~/app/tmp/cache/views/

		***
		This step is very important, if the cache is not cleared, NeutrinoCMS
		will not be aware of the update and will end up in an infinite loop!
		***

	* In your browser, open
		http://<yoursite>/
		or
		http://<yoursite>/setup/update

	* Follow the on-screen instructions

	* Done!
